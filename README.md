# Payload Blog Website

This website is being built using Payload CMS to test out a proof of concept. I want to build a website builder similar to wordpress, but I am starting from a single website to beging with. This project will later extend into different users being able to build and publish their own websites.

## Attributes

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage Adapter**: localDisk (for now)
